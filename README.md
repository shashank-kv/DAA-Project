# Steganography Using Genetic Algorithm and Visual Crytpography

A project which aims at minimizing the threat of steganalysis on stego-images. The security of the image is enhanced by using a genetic algorithm to modify the location of the pixel and using visual cryptography to encrypt the stego-image.
